# Open House Machine Skill

> **Purpose:** Most agents treat open houses as something they have to do. This skill turns every open house into a systematic lead generation machine — pre-event promotion that fills the room, day-of scripts that qualify every visitor, and post-event follow-up that converts attendees into clients.

---

## PREREQUISITE
- **Glif MCP** — optional, for generating open house promo graphics
- **Perplexity MCP** — optional, for pulling neighborhood context into social posts

---

## WHAT THIS SKILL DOES

Takes one listing and one date and generates everything the agent needs
to run a high-conversion open house — before, during, and after.

### Pre-Event (7 days before)
- 3-post social media countdown series
- Email invite to buyer database
- Email invite to sphere of influence
- Neighbor door-knock script + leave-behind note
- Facebook event copy
- Targeted social ad copy (Facebook lead form ads, radius targeting)
- Glif graphic prompts (or finished graphics if Glif connected)

### Day-Of
- Sign-in sheet with qualifying questions
- Conversation scripts for 5 visitor types
- Feedback questions for the seller report

### Post-Event (same day)
- Personalized follow-up for each visitor category
- Seller update report with attendance, feedback, and recommendations
- Social recap post
- Non-attendee follow-up for people who RSVP'd but didn't show

## WHAT THIS SKILL DOES NOT DO

- Does not generate listing photos or virtual tours
- Does not create the listing itself (that's /listing-arsenal)
- Does not pull comps or pricing (that's /comp-crusher)
- Does not build long-term nurture sequences (that's /nurture-coach)
- Does not schedule or post content to platforms

## INPUTS NEEDED

| Input | Required | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Property address | Yes | "4821 Cedar Ln, Dallas TX 75214" |
| Open house date/time | Yes | "Saturday March 15, 1-3 PM" |
| List price | Yes | "$425,000" |
| Key features | Helpful | "Pool, updated kitchen, corner lot" |
| Agent name | Helpful | "Sarah Johnson" |
| Agent phone | Helpful | "214-555-0192" |
| Number of visitors | Post-event | "12 groups came through" |
| Visitor notes | Post-event | "3 hot buyers, 5 neighbors, 2 with agents" |

> **Minimum viable input:** Address + date/time + list price. Everything else improves the output.

---

## GOAL

- Primary: Fill the open house with qualified visitors who are ready to buy or sell
- Secondary: Convert every attendee into a pipeline lead (buyer, seller, or sphere)
- Tertiary: Give the seller a professional report that reinforces trust

---

## PRE-EVENT CAMPAIGN (Generate 7 Days Before)

### 1. Social Media Countdown — 3 Posts

Each post targets a different angle. Never repeat the same hook.

**Post 1 — Teaser (5 days out)**
- Hook: One standout feature of the property
- Format: Single image + short caption
- Goal: Create curiosity, save the date
- Platform: Facebook, Instagram, Nextdoor

**Post 2 — Neighborhood/Lifestyle (3 days out)**
- Hook: Why someone would want to live HERE (not just in this house)
- Format: Carousel or multi-image showing the area
- Goal: Attract people who love the neighborhood (buyers AND neighbors)
- Platform: Facebook, Instagram

**Post 3 — Final Reminder (Day before)**
- Hook: "See you tomorrow" with full details
- Format: Single image with address, time, agent contact
- Goal: Drive attendance from people who saved the earlier posts
- Platform: Facebook, Instagram, Nextdoor, Facebook event update

**Post tone:** Casual, specific, no hype. Reference real features and real
neighborhood details. Never use "stunning" or "gorgeous" or "don't miss out."

### 2. Email Invite — Buyer Database

Subject line options (pick the most relevant):
- "Open house Saturday — [neighborhood], [beds]bd under [$price]"
- "[Address] is open this [day] — worth a look if you're watching [area]"
- "New on the market in [neighborhood] — come see it [day]"

Body structure:
- One sentence: what and when
- Three bullets: standout features
- One sentence: why this neighborhood matters
- CTA: "Stop by [time] or reply to schedule a private showing"
- Agent name + phone

**No "Hope this finds you well." No "I'd love to show you." Just the info.**

### 3. Email Invite — Sphere of Influence

Different from the buyer email. Sphere members get a personal tone.

Subject line: "Come check this out Saturday — [neighborhood]"

Body structure:
- "Hey [Name]" — casual open
- "I've got an open house this [day] at [address]"
- "Even if you're not looking, it's a cool house — [one feature]"
- "Plus I always have good snacks"
- "If you know anyone who might be interested, send them my way"
- Agent name

**This email is about maintaining the relationship, not selling.**

### 4. Neighbor Outreach — Door-Knock Script + Leave-Behind

**Door-knock script (30 seconds max):**

```
"Hi, I'm [Agent Name] — I'm hosting an open house this [day]
at [address], just [down the street / around the corner / a few
houses from you].

Wanted to personally invite you. It's from [time] to [time].

Even if you're not thinking about moving, it's a great way to
see what homes in the neighborhood are going for. Plus, if you
know anyone who'd love to live near you, send them over.

See you [day]?"
```

**Leave-behind note (for when they're not home):**

```

## DAY-OF MATERIALS

### 1. Sign-In Sheet Questions

Every visitor signs in. These questions qualify them without feeling
like an interrogation.

```
  SIGN-IN SHEET

  Name: _______________________________

  Email: ______________________________

  Phone: ______________________________

  Are you currently working with
  a real estate agent?              [ ] Yes  [ ] No

  What brought you in today?
  [ ] Interested in buying this home
  [ ] Interested in buying in the area
  [ ] Curious about home values (homeowner nearby)
  [ ] Just looking around
  [ ] Other: _________________________

  How soon are you looking to
  buy or sell?
  [ ] Right now (0-3 months)
  [ ] Soon (3-6 months)
  [ ] Eventually (6-12 months)
  [ ] Not looking — just curious
```

### 2. Conversation Scripts by Visitor Type

**Nosy Neighbor:**
Goal: Convert to seller lead.
```
OPEN WITH:
  "Do you live in the neighborhood? How long have you been here?"

BUILD RAPPORT:
  "What do you think of the changes around here? I've been tracking
  sales in [neighborhood] and it's been [moving / steady / shifting]."

PLANT THE SEED:
  "Have you ever been curious what your place might be worth?
  The numbers have been pretty interesting in this pocket.
  I can pull it up for you — takes me about a day."

CLOSE:
  "Let me get your email — I'll send you a quick snapshot
  of what homes like yours are selling for."
```

**Buyer Without Agent:**
Goal: Convert to buyer client.
```
OPEN WITH:
  "What are you looking for? How long have you been searching?"

QUALIFY:
  "Have you gotten pre-approved yet? That's the biggest thing —
  sellers around here want to see that upfront."

DEMONSTRATE VALUE:
  "This part of [neighborhood] has been averaging [DOM] days
  on market. Homes in this price range move [fast/steady].
  [One specific market detail]."

CLOSE:
  "I've got access to listings before they hit Zillow — a lot
  of the good ones go fast in this area. Want me to set up
  alerts for you? What's the best email?"
```

**Buyer With Agent:**
Goal: Provide value. Stay on their radar.
```
APPROACH:
  Be helpful, not competitive. Give honest opinions about
  the property. Answer questions thoroughly.

IF THEY ASK YOUR OPINION:
  "Honestly, for [price] in [neighborhood], this one [honest
  assessment — don't oversell your own listing]. The [feature]
  is the standout."

LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN:
  "If anything changes or you need a second opinion on anything,
  feel free to reach out." (hand them your card)

DO NOT:
  - Bad-mouth their agent
  - Actively recruit them
  - Push your services
```

**Investor:**
Goal: Investment analysis angle.
```
OPEN WITH:
  "Are you looking at this as a primary or an investment?"

IF INVESTMENT:
  "Have you looked at the rental numbers in this area?
  [Beds]-beds in [ZIP] are pulling [$X-$X] per month.
  At [list price], that's [rough yield] before expenses."

DEMONSTRATE:
  "I work with a few investors in this area. The ones
  doing well are [one specific pattern — long-term holds,
  BRRRR, etc.]. The numbers work if you're buying right."

CLOSE:
  "I can run a full investment analysis on this one or
  anything else you're looking at. What's your email?"
```

**Casual Visitor (Lookie-Loo):**
Goal: Qualify interest level. Add to database.
```
OPEN WITH:
  "What caught your eye about this one?"

LISTEN FOR SIGNALS:
  - If they mention a specific feature → they're more interested
    than they're letting on. Ask follow-up questions.
  - If they mention their own home → potential seller lead.
    "How does this compare to your place?"
  - If they mention a friend/family member → referral opportunity.
    "If they'd like to see it, I can do a private showing."

CLOSE (light touch):
  "Thanks for coming by. If you know anyone looking in
  [neighborhood], send them my way — I always have good
  data on this area."
```

### 3. Feedback Questions (for Seller Report)

Ask each visitor (naturally, not as a survey):

```
1. "What was your first impression when you walked in?"

2. "How does the price feel to you compared to other
   homes you've seen?"

3. "Anything that would stop you from making an offer?"
   (Listen for: price, condition, layout, location concerns)

4. "How does this compare to other homes you've looked at?"
```

Track answers mentally or on a notepad. These feed into the
post-event seller report.

Want to set up a second look this week?"
```

Email:
```
Subject: [Address] — quick follow-up from today

Hi [Name],

Good meeting you at the open house today. Based on what
you mentioned about [their criteria], this one checks a

Subject: Great meeting you at [address]

Hi [Name],

Thanks for stopping by today. Sounds like you're in
good hands with your agent.

I put together a quick market snapshot for [neighborhood]
that might be useful as you're comparing — [one data point
about the area]. Happy to share if you'd like it.

```

Email:
```
Subject: Great meeting you — here's what [neighborhood] looks like

Hi [Name],

Good to put a face with the neighborhood today.
[Address] got some solid traffic — [X] groups came through.

Since you live nearby, you're probably curious what that
means for your home's value. I can put together a quick
comparison — what similar homes have actually sold for
in the last few months, not just online estimates.

No strings attached. Just good to know where you stand.
Want me to run it?

[Agent Name]
[Phone]
```

**Investor — send within 4 hours:**

Email:
```
Subject: [Address] — investment numbers

investment side, so I ran some quick numbers:

- Estimated rent: [$X-$X]/month for [beds]-bed in [ZIP]
- Rough yield: [X]% gross
- [One insight about the area for investors]

If you want a deeper analysis — cash flow projections,
cap rate, holding costs — I can build that out. I also
track off-market opportunities in this ZIP.

What's your buy criteria? I'll keep an eye out.

[Agent Name]
[Phone]
```

**Not Interested / Casual — send next day:**

Email only:

  Generate PERSONALIZED follow-ups for each visitor

IF agent says "need day-of materials" →
  Generate sign-in sheet + conversation scripts + feedback Qs

  NEIGHBOR DOOR-KNOCK SCRIPT

  ──────────────────────────────────────────────

  "Hi, I'm Sarah Johnson — I'm hosting an
  open house this Saturday at 4821 Cedar,
  just down the street from you.

  Wanted to personally invite you. It's from
  1 to 3 PM.

  Even if you're not thinking about moving,
  it's a great way to see what homes in
  Lakewood are going for right now. The
  kitchen and pool both got updated — worth
  a look.

  Plus, if you know anyone who'd love to
  live near you, send them over.

  See you Saturday?"

### Example Input (Post-Event — Hot Buyer):
> Open house is done. 12 groups came through. One hot buyer — Mike Torres, no agent, loved the pool, pre-approved at $450K, wants to come back for a second look.

### Example Output (Post-Event Follow-Up — Hot Buyer):

```
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────

  FOLLOW-UP: Mike Torres
  Category: HOT BUYER (no agent)
  Priority: Respond within 2 hours

  ──────────────────────────────────────────────

  SMS (copy-paste):

  "Hi Mike — good meeting you at Cedar Ln
  today. I could tell you liked that pool.
  The seller is motivated and we haven't seen
  competing offers yet. Want to come back for
  a second look this week? I'm free Tuesday
  or Thursday."

  Email:

  Subject: 4821 Cedar Ln — quick follow-up
  from today

  Hi Mike,

  Good meeting you at the open house today.
  Based on what you mentioned, this one checks
  a lot of your boxes — the pool with the new
  decking, the updated kitchen, and the lot
  size on a corner.

  A few things worth knowing:
  - Lakewood homes in this range average 18
    days on market — this one just listed
  - Your pre-approval at $450K puts you in a
    strong position at the $425K ask
  - Corner lots in this pocket don't come up
    often

  Want to come back for a private showing
  this week? I can also pull 2-3 other homes
  in the area that match what you described.
  Just say the word.

### Example Output (Post-Event Follow-Up — Neighbor):

```
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────

  FOLLOW-UP: Karen Patel (neighbor)
  Category: NEIGHBOR
  Priority: Send within 4 hours

  ──────────────────────────────────────────────

  SMS (copy-paste):

  "Hi Karen — thanks for stopping by today.
  Great to meet a Cedar Ln neighbor. I
  mentioned I could pull up what your home
  might be worth — want me to run those
  numbers? Takes about a day."

  Email:

  Subject: Great meeting you — here's what
  Lakewood looks like right now

  Hi Karen,

  Good to put a face with the neighborhood
  today. 4821 Cedar Ln got solid traffic — 12
  groups came through in two hours.

  Since you live right there on Cedar, you're
  probably curious what that means for your
  home's value. Short answer: Lakewood has
  been strong. Homes in your range are moving
  in about 18 days and selling within 2% of
  asking.

  I can put together a detailed comparison —
  what similar homes have actually closed for
  in the last few months, not just online
  estimates. No strings attached. Just good
  to know where you stand.

  Want me to run it?

| Glif graphics require MCP connection | Falls back to detailed prompts the agent can use elsewhere |
