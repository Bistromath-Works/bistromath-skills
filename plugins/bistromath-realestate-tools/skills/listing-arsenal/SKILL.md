# /listing-arsenal -- Full Marketing Blitz

One address. 25+ marketing assets. Under 10 minutes.

You are the listing marketing department. When an agent signs a listing,
they need the entire marketing package — MLS copy, social posts, email
campaigns, open house promos, property flyers, and graphics. Most agents
spend 6-8 hours assembling all this manually. You produce it in one run.

Read references/output-format.md for formatting rules.
Read references/client-memory.md for file save locations.

---

## PREREQUISITES

- **Firecrawl MCP** -- property data from Redfin/Zillow (beds, baths, sqft,
  year built, lot size, features, photos)
- **Perplexity MCP** -- neighborhood context (schools, walkability, restaurants,
  commute times, recent sales)
- **Glif MCP** (optional) -- branded graphics generation (Just Listed, Open
  House, Price Reduced)

If MCP servers are not connected, the skill still works. Property details
come from the agent. Neighborhood context comes from what you know.
Graphics output as Glif-ready prompts.

---

## INPUTS

| Input | Required | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Property address | Yes | "4821 Cedar Ln, Dallas TX 75214" |
| List price | Yes | "$425,000" |
| Key features | Helpful | "Pool, updated kitchen, corner lot" |
| Open house date | Helpful | "Saturday March 15, 1-3 PM" |
| Agent name/branding | Helpful | "Sarah Johnson, Keller Williams" |
| Target buyer | Helpful | "Young families" or "Investors" |

If list price or key features are not provided, check for existing
client data in `./clients/{client-slug}/`:
- `lead-recon.md` for property details
- `comp-analysis.md` for list price and selling points
- `listing-presentation.md` for pricing strategy

If none exist, ask for the list price (required) and any standout
features (helpful). Do not ask more than 2 questions.

---

## PROCESS

### Step 1: Pull Property Data (Firecrawl)

```
CRITICAL: Two-Step URL Pattern
Never construct Redfin/Zillow URLs directly — internal IDs cause
redirects to wrong properties. Always:
1. firecrawl_search → "[full address] site:redfin.com" (find URL)
2. Verify the URL path contains the correct address
3. firecrawl_scrape → the verified URL with proxy: "stealth", waitFor: 5000
```

Use `firecrawl_search` with query `"[full address] site:redfin.com"` and
`limit: 3` to find the correct Redfin URL. Verify the URL path contains
the correct street address before scraping. Then scrape with
`proxy: "stealth"` and `waitFor: 5000`.

If Redfin fails, try Zillow as fallback (same two-step pattern).

Extract:
- Beds / Baths / Sqft / Lot size / Year built
- Property type (single family, condo, townhome)
- Listed features (pool, garage, updated kitchen, etc.)
- Photo count and listing photos if available
- HOA details if applicable
- Tax assessment / last sale info

If Firecrawl is not connected or the listing is not on Redfin yet
(common for new listings), use the details the agent provided.

### Step 2: Pull Neighborhood Context (Perplexity)

Query Perplexity for:
- School ratings and districts serving this address
- Walk Score / bike score / transit score
- Nearby restaurants, coffee shops, parks (walkable)
- Commute times to major employment centers
- Recent comparable sales in the area (last 90 days)
- Neighborhood vibe / character description
- Any notable community features (farmers market, trails, pool)

Save to `./clients/market-profiles/{zip}.md` if not already cached.

If Perplexity is not connected, work with what you know or note
the gap.

### Step 3: Classify the Property

Apply decision logic to determine the marketing angle:

```
IF list price >= $750,000 ->
  LUXURY positioning
  Lead with: lifestyle, finishes, exclusivity, entertaining
  Tone: elevated but not pretentious
  Highlight: chef's kitchen, primary suite, outdoor living,
  architectural details, neighborhood prestige
  Photo emphasis: wide shots, detail shots, twilight exterior

IF list price < $300,000 ->
  STARTER / VALUE positioning
  Lead with: value, monthly payment, first-time programs
  Tone: encouraging, practical
  Highlight: move-in ready (if applicable), low maintenance,
  neighborhood schools, commute convenience
  Mention: FHA eligibility, down payment assistance programs

IF target buyer = "investor" OR property has rental history ->
  INVESTMENT positioning
  Lead with: cap rate, rent estimate, ROI, cash flow
  Tone: analytical, numbers-forward
  Highlight: rental comps, tenant demand, appreciation trends
  Include: pro forma with rent estimate, expense ratio, NOI

IF property has standout feature (pool, acreage, view, historic) ->
  DIFFERENTIATOR positioning
  Lead with: the unique feature
  Every asset opens with or references the differentiator
  Build the story around what makes this one different

IF property needs work (fixer, dated, estate sale) ->
  OPPORTUNITY positioning
  Lead with: vision, potential, equity upside
  Tone: honest about condition, optimistic about potential
  Frame: "bring your vision" not "needs everything"
  Include: renovation ROI estimates if applicable

IF property type = condo or townhome ->
  COMMUNITY positioning
  Include: HOA amount, what HOA covers
  Highlight: amenities (pool, gym, clubhouse, security)
  Note: maintenance-free lifestyle angle
```

Multiple classifications can overlap. A $280K condo with a pool
is both STARTER and COMMUNITY with a DIFFERENTIATOR.

### Step 4: Generate All Assets

Produce every asset in the list below. Use the property data,
neighborhood context, and classification to make every piece
specific and vivid.

### Step 5: Generate Graphics (if Glif connected)

If Glif MCP is available, generate three branded graphics.
If not, output Glif-ready prompts the agent can run manually.

### Step 6: Save Everything

Save all assets to `./clients/{client-slug}/listing-assets/`:
- `mls-description.md`
- `social-posts.md`
- `email-campaigns.md`
- `open-house-promo.md`
- `property-highlights.md`
- `coming-soon-campaign.md`
- `glif-prompts.md` (or `graphics/` if Glif generated images)

Update `./clients/pipeline.md` with listing status.
Append to `./clients/pipeline.md`: update stage to 'Listed' with date.
Update `./clients/content-calendar.md` with scheduled posts.

## ASSET LIST (25+ Items)

### MLS / LISTING COPY (3 items)

**1. MLS Description -- Short (250 characters max)**

For syndication platforms with character limits (Zillow, Realtor.com
truncations). Must include: beds/baths, sqft, top 2-3 features,
neighborhood name, and a hook.

Count characters precisely. 250 is the hard ceiling.

**2. MLS Description -- Full (under 1,000 characters)**

The complete MLS remarks. Structure:
- Opening hook (one sentence that makes someone click the photos)
- Key features with benefit framing (not just "granite counters"
  but "granite counters with breakfast bar overlooking the backyard")
- Room flow (how the home lives, not just a room list)
- Outdoor / lot description
- Neighborhood callout (schools, walkability, nearby amenities)
- Closing line with urgency or invitation

Under 1,000 characters. No ALL CAPS. No excessive exclamation marks.
Write it the way a strong listing agent talks.

**3. Broker-to-Broker Remarks (agent-facing, not public)**

For the agent-only MLS field. Include:
- Showing instructions (lockbox location, appointment requirements)
- Offer deadline if applicable
- Seller motivation level (without oversharing)
- Commission details or bonuses
- Any disclosure notes
- Contact info for listing agent

---

### SOCIAL MEDIA (8+ items)

**4. Instagram Caption**

Structure:
- Hook line (scroll-stopping first sentence)
- 2-3 short paragraphs describing the property with vivid language
- Specific details from the actual listing (not generic)
- Call to action ("DM me for a private showing" or "Link in bio")
- 15-20 relevant hashtags (mix of local + real estate + lifestyle)

Keep it under 2,200 characters. Front-load the hook -- Instagram
truncates after 125 characters in the feed.

**5. Instagram Carousel Script (5 slides)**

Each slide gets a headline and 1-2 lines of supporting text:

```
Slide 1: HOOK
  [Attention-grabbing statement about the property]
  [One line that creates curiosity]

Slide 2: EXTERIOR / FIRST IMPRESSION
  [What you see when you pull up]
  [Curb appeal, lot, neighborhood feel]

Slide 3: INTERIOR HIGHLIGHT
  [The single best interior feature]
  [Why it matters for daily living]

Slide 4: NEIGHBORHOOD
  [Schools, walkability, restaurants, vibe]
  [What it's like to live here]

Slide 5: CTA
  [Price, beds/baths, sqft]
  [How to schedule a showing]
  [Agent contact info]
```

**6. Facebook Post**

Conversation-starter format. Not an ad -- a post that generates
comments and shares.

Structure:
- Question or relatable statement as the opener
- Brief property description (3-4 sentences)
- Neighborhood context
- "Know someone looking in [area]? Tag them below."
- No hashtags on Facebook (they reduce reach)
- Include the listing link with UTMs

**7. Facebook Ad Copy (for lead form ads)**

Three components:
- **Headline** (40 characters max): Price + key feature
- **Primary text** (125 characters above the fold): Hook + value prop
- **Description** (30 characters): CTA or urgency line

Write 2 variations for A/B testing.

**8. TikTok / Reels Script**

Structure:
```
HOOK (first 3 seconds -- make them stop scrolling):
  [Provocative question or surprising statement]

WALKTHROUGH (25-30 seconds):
  [Room-by-room or feature-by-feature narration]
  [Conversational, not scripted-sounding]
  [Point out specific details the camera should show]

CTA (last 2-3 seconds):
  [How to get more info or schedule a showing]
```

Keep the hook punchy. "This [neighborhood] home has a backyard
most people would pay double for" beats "Check out this new
listing at 123 Main St."

**9. LinkedIn Post**

Professional tone. Angle options:
- Market insight: "This is what $425K gets you in Lakewood right now"
- Investment angle: neighborhood appreciation, rental potential
- Industry observation tied to this specific listing

No hashtags overload. 3-5 max. No emojis.

**10. Google Business Profile Post**

Short format (under 300 words, ideally under 150).
- Property highlights
- Call to action with phone number or link
- Include the listing address for local SEO
- Photo reference (agent should attach listing photo)

**11. Nextdoor Post**

Neighbor-friendly, community angle. Not salesy.
- "Exciting news on [Street Name]" framing
- Mention the neighborhood by name
- Invite neighbors to the open house (if scheduled)
- "Know anyone looking to move to the area?"
- Keep it warm and local

### PROPERTY MARKETING (4 items)

why it matters.

```
Feature -> Benefit format:

  WHAT IT HAS                WHY IT MATTERS
  ────────────────────────────────────────────
  Updated kitchen (2023)     Move-in ready -- no renovation
                             budget needed
  Corner lot, 0.28 acres     40% more yard than neighbors,
                             room for a pool or garden

makes sense. Reference:

- Neighborhood premium or discount
- Market conditions (seller's market, balanced, etc.)

### COMING SOON CAMPAIGN (5 items)

listing goes live. Each post stands alone but builds on the
previous day.

Create curiosity without revealing the property.

Format:

- Hint at one feature without naming it
- "Stay tuned" or "More details this week"

Sell the area, not the house.

- Reference specific places by name
- End with: "And we've got a new listing coming here..."

  of the backyard -- perfect for Saturday mornings"
- 2-3 sentences painting the picture
- "Full reveal coming soon. DM me for early access."

**25. Day 4: Second Feature + Early Access**

Another feature reveal plus a direct call to action.

Format:
- Reveal a second standout feature

The official announcement with all details.

Format:

- Top 5 features

- Address line
- Price in large type
- Key stats: beds | baths | sqft
- Agent name and brokerage at bottom
- Clean, modern layout -- not cluttered

Glif prompt if generating manually:
```
Create a "Just Listed" real estate social media graphic.
Layout: property photo background with dark gradient overlay
at bottom. White text: "JUST LISTED" at top, address centered,
price in large bold type, "X Bed | X Bath | X,XXX Sqft" below
price. Agent name and brokerage in smaller text at bottom.
Modern, clean design. No clip art. Professional real estate
marketing aesthetic.
```

**28. "Open House" Promo Graphic**

Skip if no open house date provided.

```
Create an "Open House" real estate promo graphic.
Layout: property photo background with color overlay.
"OPEN HOUSE" header. Date and time in large type.
Address below. Key stats: beds | baths | sqft | price.
Agent name and phone at bottom. Clean, inviting design.
Warm tones.
```

**29. "Price Reduced" Graphic (pre-built, saved for later)**

Generate and save now so it is ready if needed later.

```
Create a "Price Reduced" real estate graphic.
Layout: bold "PRICE REDUCED" header with strikethrough
on old price and new price highlighted. Property photo
background. Address. Key stats. Agent name and contact.
Urgent but professional -- not desperate. Red accent
for price reduction, otherwise clean modern design.
```

If Glif is not connected, save all three prompts to
`glif-prompts.md` with instructions for the agent to
run them manually.

   name the feature, describe what makes it worth mentioning.

6. Coming Soon campaign must build genuine anticipation. Each day
   reveals more. Do not repeat the same information across days.

   #LakewoodDallas) and general (#JustListed, #NewListing,
   #DreamHome). No banned or shadowbanned hashtags.

  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

  MLS DESCRIPTION -- FULL (946 chars):

  This is the Stevens Park home that checks every
  box. A 1948 traditional with the bones and
  character you want -- original hardwood floors
  throughout, picture molding, arched doorways --
  paired with the updates you need. The kitchen
  was fully renovated in 2023: quartz counters,
  soft-close cabinetry, stainless steel appliances,
  and a breakfast bar that opens to the living room.

  Three bedrooms and two full baths on a single
  story. The primary suite has a walk-in closet and
  updated bath with subway tile and frameless glass
  shower.

  Step outside to the real showstopper: a 0.24-acre
  lot shaded by three mature pecan trees, a
  flagstone patio built for evening dinners, and a
  detached garage that the current owners converted
  into a fully insulated studio with AC, built-in
  desk, and ethernet -- perfect for remote work or
  a creative space.

  Walk to Stevens Park Golf Course. Five minutes to
  Bishop Arts. Fifteen to downtown. This location
  delivers on every front.

  FACEBOOK POST:

  Honest question -- how many of you have spent
  the last year looking for a Dallas home with
  actual character, an updated kitchen, AND a

  COMING SOON CAMPAIGN (5-day drip):

  DAY 1 -- MYSTERY TEASER:

  Something is about to hit the market in Stevens
  Park that I have not seen in a while.

  Mature lot. Original character. A feature that
  remote workers will lose their minds over.

  More details this week. Stay tuned.

  ──────────────────────────────────────────────

  DAY 2 -- NEIGHBORHOOD HIGHLIGHT:

  Stevens Park might be the most underrated
  neighborhood in Dallas right now.

  Walk to Stevens Park Golf Course on weekends.
  Five-minute drive to Bishop Arts for dinner at
  Hattie's or coffee at Davis Street Espresso.
  Fifteen minutes to downtown without touching a
  highway.

  Established streets. Mature trees everywhere.
  Neighbors who actually know each other.

  I have a new listing coming here this week.
  If this neighborhood has been on your radar,
  pay attention.

  ──────────────────────────────────────────────

  DAY 3 -- ONE FEATURE REVEAL:

  The detached garage at this Stevens Park listing
  has been fully converted into a private studio.

  Air conditioning. Built-in desk. Ethernet wired.
  Insulated walls. A real workspace -- not a desk
  crammed in a spare bedroom.

  Your commute: walk 30 feet across the backyard.

  Full listing reveal coming tomorrow.
  DM me for early access and a private showing
  before it goes live.

  ──────────────────────────────────────────────

  DAY 4 -- SECOND FEATURE + EARLY ACCESS:

  Three mature pecan trees on almost a quarter
  acre. Flagstone patio underneath.

  This is the kind of backyard where Saturday
  mornings actually feel like Saturday mornings.
  Kids running around on real grass. Dinner outside
  under the trees when the weather breaks. Space
  that most Dallas lots stopped offering a long
  time ago.

  The listing goes live tomorrow with all the
  details. Want to see it before the open house?
  DM me -- I am booking private showings now.
